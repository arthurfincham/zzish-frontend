Step 1
Create search box with state handled value - search box updates this state with onChange.
This should let me pass the value to the API as it updates.

Step 2
Create pagination with state handled value.
Again, I should be able to pass this to the API as an offset to reduce calls.

Will limit pagination to 10 pages of 10 gifs for now.
